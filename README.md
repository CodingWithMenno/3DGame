## 3D Java Game using OpenGL

### Game idea
 A difficult and funny party game with a small open world which in you can play for hours long (based on the game: Toy Story 3).
 
 - A small open world where there is a lot of funny and cool stuff to do.
 - The open world must be very customizable.
 - The world contains short (story line) missions which change the world around you.
 - The game contains a lot of (hard) party games (which are always replayable).
 - There are a lot of funny things to find (for example: easter eggs (to my previous games)) and do in the open world.
 - The game has split screen support.
 - You can interact with every character in the game (throw them, punch them, etc.).
